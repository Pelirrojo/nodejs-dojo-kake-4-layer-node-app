# nodejs-dojo-kake-4-layer-node-app

Weâ€™re going to design a 4 layers architecture by collaborating.

## The rules:
* 2/3 people by team
* One team, one role
* Speak only with your next teams to share api or data
* 4 layers: Frontend + Auth Server + Load Balancer + Backend

## References & Examples

* Superagent to connect DB API [example](https://github.com/beeva-manueldepaz/dojo-triple/tree/dojo-01-kata-resolved)
* Request to proxify [example](http://github.com/pelirrojo/https://github.com/Pelirrojo/nodejs-npm-express-basic-with-grunt)
* A 'little SPA' frontend with JQuery: 
use as [example](https://gist.github.com/Pelirrojo/c537c30952573d3fd62c) 
*  db endpoint is: http://10.10.8.90:7474

Good Luck!
